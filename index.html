Lawmakwers had to consider everything from public safety to atoning for some of the War on Drugs’ injustices, to zoning, to tax revenue, and everything in between, all against the backdrop of an industry-wide oversupply crisis that has dragged prices down, forced businesses into crisis and called into question the viability of other states’ legalization models.</p>

                    <p class = "graf">Such a complex issue has resulted in a complex law. The version of the bill that passed through Maryland’s state legislature is over 100 pages of dense legal text that lays out each aspect of legalization in considerable detail and with considerable care. But as Marylanders wonder what the functioning recreational market will look like in practice, not many have the time to pore over a 100-page document.</p>
